        <h2 class="center header">What is Bolognese?</h2>
        <p class="center intro">So, what makes Bolognese different than a typical spaghetti sauce? 
        While both are tomato-based meat sauces made with garlic and onion, 
        bolognese also includes the addition of celery and carrot plus a little bit of milk. 
        It may sound unusual, but these ingredients add a distinct flavor, a bit of richness, and some sweetness.</p>
