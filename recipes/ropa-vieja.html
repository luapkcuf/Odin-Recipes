        <h2 class="center subtitle">What is Ropa Vieja?</h2>

        <p class="center body">Shredded beef and vegetables that resemble a heap of colorful rags  – that’s Ropa Vieja.  
        From the Spanish term for “old clothes”, this is one of Cuba’s most popular and beloved dishes. 
        So popular in fact that it’s one of the country’s designated national dishes.</p>

        <p class="center body">This dish dates back to the Middle Ages of Spanish Sephardi, a loose adaptation of a dish that remains popular in southern and central Spain.  Traditionally it was a way to stretch the leftovers of stews such as puchero or cocida, both of which are garbanzo-based dishes as is the original Spanish version of Ropa Vieja.  This dish was later taken to Cuba where the Cubans made it their own.</p>

        <p class="center body">Central in this dish are beef and tomatoes, both naturally umami-rich ingredients.  Added to that are zesty bell peppers, caramelized onions, and to that we’re going to add some additional ingredients and spices that will make your taste buds sing with joy!</p>
